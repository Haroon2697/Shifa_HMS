## ❗ Browser Console Errors (Can Ignore)

You may see these harmless errors:
- `share-modal.js` - Browser extension issue (not your app)
- `listener indicated asynchronous response` - Browser extension conflict
- `Using the user object...` - Supabase security warning (expected)

These don't affect login functionality!

## 🐛 If Login Still Fails

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. **Try incognito/private mode** (disables extensions)
3. **Check browser console** for actual app errors
4. **Verify Supabase dashboard** - make sure project is active
